This is a set of scripts to simulate the gravitational waveforms of mergers of black holes and/or neutron stars, and calculate several properties of these mergers and waveforms.

The first script in the process is “1_GW_simulator”, which simulates the gravitational waveform of a given merger. The inputs to this script that can be adjusted are listed at the start in the “Input constants” section. The two main input variables are “logMc”, which takes the logarithm base 10 of the chirp mass of the merging binary in solar masses; and “q”, which takes the mass ratio of the binary. The script has been tested for logMc between 0.0 and 2.0 and q between 0.1 and 1.0.

“1_GW_simulator” gives as output a file that describes the gravitational waveform that would be produced by the binary with the properties in the inputs; it is an array of data points where the first column is time from the start of the model, the second column is the frequency of the gravitational wave at that time and the third is the amplitude of the strain at that time.

In “1_GW_simulator”, the distance from the binary to the observer is taken by default to be 100 Mpc; adjustment for the distance to the binary is instead done by subsequent scripts in the process. Similar, this script assumes the inclination angle of the binary is zero (i.e. perfect alignment), and adjustment for the effect of imperfect alignment is done by subsequent scripts.

Using a gravitational waveform file output by “1_GW_simulator”, the subsequent scripts can calculate various properties of the gravitational wave. “2_SNR_calculator_single_detector” calculates the SNR of a given merger at a given distance for a given single gravitational wave detector. As with the previous script, the input variables are specified in the “Inputs” section at the beginning of the script. “inputarray” should point to a gravitational wave array output from “1_GW_simulator”, the variable “d” takes the distance to the merger in Mpc and “noisearray” should point to a noise spectrum for a gravitational wave detector; it expects an array with the first column a list of frequencies and the second column the ASD of noise in the detector at those frequencies. For our calculations, we used these LIGO noise curves: https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1500293/public
